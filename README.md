# TacklingDisinformation
A simple Java project on tackling dis-information, initially developed for curricular assessment. In for public access now, since it proves to be an apt foundation for any program that builds onto that, with similar objective. Better viewed as a prototype, it's a simple java project that utilizes built-in libraries -swings,awt etc.
 Featured below is an extract from the presentation introducing the project. It provides an apt overview of the project, thus being a concise way to comprehend everything that the project set out to do, before utilizing it in your own project.
 
Introduction

Goal of the project -The reach and rate of disinformation in post world war-2 globalization era is getting higher day by day. -Thus, the purpose of this project is to bring awareness in the various fields this is prevalent, so consumers and producers can follow up with caution. -I intend to recommend various practices to dodge dis-information and put the medium of dis-info to better use.

Limitations of existing projects -The existing efforts to tackle this are sadly minimal in exposure and are not well integrated i.e, they rely heavily on user's discretion. -The aggressive nature of dis-info campaigns are turning heads from mass-awareness

Why I chose this and it's relevance- -The low amount of discretion this topic is bringing made us to explore and cultivate solutions for this subject -It is highly relevant than ever to combat the wide-spread dis-info campaigns rampant today.

Problem statement

-Various social groups or blindsided masses are propagating the spread of Dis-information campaigns .It is resultant of the reach and rate of disinformation in post world war-2 globalization era, which is getting higher day by day. -It is significant and lies in our social responsibility to combat the wide-spread dis-info campaigns rampant today.

Project Scope

-My project is limited in scope, since I can't penetrate all aspects an individual indulges in, and to dodge effects of dis-info, one must re-evaluate their interaction in social aspects. -I cover the social and edutainment domain and diet life, state recent developments, and provide our analysis.

Technologies Used

-I've drafted the code in java programming language -version 19 -To integrate GUI, we used java swings
-Notepad++ was used for IDLE -All the components of GUI you see are present in swings, to showcase what all we've acquired from the syllabus.

System Architecture

-The architecture of the program primarily aims for user-friendly use, hence the first interface eases the user into the program by introducing them and presenting a 'context and begin' button. -This window is instantiated in main method and calls a method for the next frame in actionPerformed method. -This method provides context and breifs them on the topic, and allows the user to proceed using a button. -the previous method calls a frame that breifs them on the wider possible scope by informing them on recent developments on food industry too. -It then urges the user to enter details about their routine behavior exhibited on social media and submit it. Text fields and options are provided to the user -My recommendation is then provided to the user and recommend various practices to dodge dis-information and put the medium of dis-info to better use. -Then, I provide an option to return to the main page again overriding the predefined method.

User Interface

-My aim on the user-end was to provide a swift and effortless navigation of the program. - hence the first interface eases the user into the program by introducing them and presenting a 'context and begin' button. -MY UI design follows the basic principles highlighting the text upfront and breathe-space to present the button. -The frames are simple yet effective in it's form to avoid exhaustion.

Future Enhancements -My project is limited in scope, since we can't penetrate all aspects an individual indulges in, and to dodge effects of dis-info, one must re-evaluate their interaction in social aspects. -Widening of project's scope would see efforts towards informing and analyzing on the many elements that for the social sphere
